# Competitive-Programming-2023

## What is Competitive Programming??

Competitive programming is a type of intellectual sport or mind sport that involves solving well-defined algorithmic and computational problems within a specified time limit. Participants, often called competitive programmers, use programming languages to devise efficient solutions to these problems.

### *The goal is to find the correct and most efficient solution within the given time frame.*

Just comment on the issue you want to code for. To contribute, simply follow the steps below!

## Contributing to this Repo

1. Fork [this](https://github.com/Google-Developer-Student-Club-CCOEW/Competitive-Programming-2023/fork) repository.

2. Clone the forked repository.

**bash**
```
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/project_name.git
```

3. Navigate to the project directory.

**bash**
```
cd Flutter
```

4. Creating a new branch (IMP) 🌱
This is one of the very important steps that you should follow to contribute to Open Source. A branch helps to manage the workflow, isolate your code and does not create a mess. To create a new branch:

**bash**
```
$ git branch <name_of_branch>
$ git checkout -b <name_of_branch>
```

Keep your cloned repo up to date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)

**bash**
```
git pull origin main
```

5. Make changes in source code. 🚀

6. Stage your changes and commit 📝

**bash**
# Add changes to Index
```
git add .
```

# Commit to the local repo
```
git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```

7. At this point you can use the git push command to push the changes to the current branch of your forked repository:

**bash**
```
git push origin <branch-name>
```

8. Create a [Pull Request/PR]
